## ü§î What is SuperchainERC20?

`SuperchainERC20` is an implementation of [ERC-7802](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7802-crosschain-token-interface/21508) designed to enable asset interoperability in the Superchain.
`SuperchainERC20` tokens are fungible across the Superchain by giving the `SuperchainERC20Bridge` permission to mint and burn the token during cross-chain transfers. For more information on SuperchainERC20 please visit the [docs](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/interop/superchain-erc20).

**Note**: ERC20 tokens that do not utilize the `SuperchainERC20Bridge` for cross-chain transfers can still achieve fungibility across the Superchain through interop message passing with a custom bridge solution. For these custom tokens, implementing [ERC-7802](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7802-crosschain-token-interface/21508) is strongly recommended, as it unifies cross-chain mint and burn interfaces, enabling tokens to benefit from a standardized approach to cross-chain transfers.

### `IERC7802`

To achieve cross-chain functionality, the `SuperchainERC20` standard incorporates the `IERC7802` interface, defining essential functions and events:

- **`crosschainMint`**: Mints tokens on the destination chain as part of a cross-chain transfer.
- **`crosschainBurn`**: Burns tokens on the source chain to facilitate the transfer.
- **Events (`CrosschainMint` and `CrosschainBurn`)**: Emit when tokens are minted or burned, enabling transparent tracking of cross-chain transactions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install prerequisites: `foundry`

`supersim` requires `anvil` to be installed.

Follow [this guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) to install Foundry.

### 2. Clone and navigate to the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ethereum-optimism/superchainerc20-starter.git
cd superchainerc20-starter
```

### 3. Install project dependencies using pnpm:

```sh
pnpm i
```

### 4. Initialize .env files:

```sh
pnpm init:env
```

### 5. Start the development environment:

This command will:

- Start the `supersim` local development environment
- Deploy the smart contracts to the test networks
- Launch the example frontend application

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## üì¶ Deploying SuperchainERC20s

### Configuring RPC urls

This repository includes a script to automatically fetch the public RPC URLs for each chain listed in the [Superchain Registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/blob/main/chainList.json) and add them to the `[rpc_endpoints]` configuration section of `foundry.toml`.

The script ensures that only new RPC URLs are appended, preserving any URLs already present in `foundry.toml`. To execute this script, run:

```sh
pnpm contracts:update:rpcs
```

### Deployment config

The deployment configuration for token deployments is managed through the `deploy-config.toml` file. Below is a detailed breakdown of each configuration section:

#### `[deploy-config]`

This section defines parameters for deploying token contracts.

- `salt`: A unique identifier used for deploying token contracts via [`Create2`]. This value along with the contract bytecode ensures that contract deployments are deterministic.
  - example: `salt = "ethers phoenix"`
- `chains`: Lists the chains where the token will be deployed. Each chain must correspond to an entry in the `[rpc_endpoints]` section of `foundry.toml`.
  - example: `chains = ["op_chain_a","op_chain_b"]`

#### `[token]`

Deployment configuration for the token that will be deployed.

- `owner_address`: the address designated as the owner of the token.
  - The `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` contract included in this repo extends the [`Ownable`](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/c3b2ffb4a3334ea519555c5ea11fb0e666f8c2bc/src/auth/Ownable.sol) contract
  - example: `owner_address = "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"`
- `name`: the token's name.
  - example: `name = "TestSuperchainERC20"`
- `symbol`: the token's symbol.
  - example: `symbol = "TSU"`
- `decimals`: the number of decimal places the token supports.
  - example: `decimals = 18`

### Deploying a token

Before proceeding with this section, ensure that your `deploy-config.toml` file is fully configured (see the [Deployment config](#deployment-config) section for more details on setup). Additionally, confirm that the `[rpc_endpoints]` section in `foundry.toml` is properly set up by following the instructions in [Configuring RPC urls](#configuring-rpc-urls).

Deployments are executed through the `SuperchainERC20Deployer.s.sol` script. This script deploys tokens across each specified chain in the deployment configuration using `Create2`, ensuring deterministic contract addresses for each deployment. The script targets the `L2NativeSuperchainERC20.sol` contract by default. If you need to modify the token being deployed, either update this file directly or point the script to a custom token contract of your choice.

To execute a token deployment run:

```sh
pnpm contracts:deploy:token

```

### Best practices for deploying SuperchainERC20

#### Use Create2 to deploy SuperchainERC20

`Create2` ensures that the address is deterministically determined by the bytecode of the contract and the provided salt. This is crucial because in order for cross-chain transfers of `SuperchainERC20`s to work with interop, the tokens must be deployed at the same address across all chains.

#### `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn` permissions

For best security practices `SuperchainERC20Bridge` should be the only contract with permission to call `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn`. These permissions are set up by default when using the `SuperchainERC20` contract.

## üß™ E2E Tests

The `packages/e2e-test` directory contains simple end-to-end integration tests using `vitest` that run against `supersim`

### Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have:

1. Completed all steps in the [Getting Started](#-getting-started) section
2. Initialized your environment variables (`pnpm init:env`)

### Running the Tests

```sh
pnpm e2e-test
```

The tests will run against your local supersim instance.

## üåâ Example: How to bridge a SuperchainERC20 token to another chain

**Note**: Interop is currently in active development and not yet ready for production use. This example uses [supersim](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim) in order to demonstrate how cross-chain transfers will work once interop is live.

**Note**: this example uses a pre-funded test account provided by anvil for all transactions and as the owner of the `L2NativeSuperchainERC20`. The address of this account is `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266` and private key is `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80`

**1. Follow the steps in the [Getting started](#getting-started) section.**

After completing these steps, you will have the following set up:

- `supersim` running in autorelay mode with two L2 chains
- The `L2NativeSuperchainERC20` token deployed on both chains

**2. Find the address and owner of the L2NativeSuperchainERC20 token that was deployed.**

The address that the token in step 1 was deployed to and the address of the owner of the token can be found in the [deployment.json](packages/contracts/deployment.json) file under the `"deployedAddress"` and `"ownerAddress"` fields. The `deployedAddress` address will be used for any token interactions in the next steps and the private key of the `ownerAddress` will need to be used for step 3 since minting requires owner privileges. In this example `deployment.json` file the token in step 1 was deployed at `0x5BCf71Ca0CE963373d917031aAFDd6D98B80B159` and the owner address is `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`:

```sh
# example
{
  "deployedAddress": "0x5BCf71Ca0CE963373d917031aAFDd6D98B80B159",
  "ownerAddress": "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266"
}
```

**3. Mint tokens to transfer on chain 901**

The following command creates a transaction using `cast` to mint 1000 `L2NativeSuperchainERC20` tokens. Replace `<deployed-token-address>` with the `deployedAddress` from [deployment.json](packages/contracts/deployment.json), replace `<recipient-address>` with the address you would like to send the tokens to, and replace `<owner-address-private-key>` with the private key of the `ownerAddress` from step [deployment.json](packages/contracts/deployment.json).

```sh
cast send <deployed-token-address> "mintTo(address _to, uint256 _amount)" <recipient-address> 1000  --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:9545 --private-key <owner-address-private-key>
```

**4. Initiate the send transaction on chain 901**

Send the tokens from Chain 901 to Chain 902 by calling `SendERC20` on the `SuperchainTokenBridge`. The `SuperchainTokenBridge` is an OP Stack predeploy and can be located at address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000028`. Replace `<deployed-token-address>` with the `deployedAddress` from [deployment.json](packages/contracts/deployment.json), replace `<recipient-address>` with the address you would like to send the tokens to, and replace `<token-sender-private-key>` with the private key of the recipient address from step 3.

```sh
cast send 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000028 "sendERC20(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount, uint256 _chainId)" <deployed-token-address> <recipient-address> 1000 902 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:9545 --private-key <token-sender-private-key>
```

**5. Wait for the relayed message to appear on chain 902**

In a few seconds, you should see the RelayedMessage on chain 902:

```sh
# example
INFO [11-01|16:02:25.089] SuperchainTokenBridge#RelayERC20 token=0x5BCf71Ca0CE963373d917031aAFDd6D98B80B159 from=0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 to=0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8 amount=1000 source=901
```

**6. Check the balance on chain 902**

Verify that the balance for the recipient of the `L2NativeSuperchainERC20` on chain 902 has increased:

```sh
cast balance --erc20 <deployed-token-address> <recipient-address> --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:9546
```

## Updating an ERC20 contract to be interoperable

This section explains how to modify an existing `ERC20` contract to make it interoperable within the Superchain.

In this example, we will update the [GovernanceToken](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/80465cd6c428d13166fce351741492f354621643/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/governance/GovernanceToken.sol) `ERC20` to make it interoperable. To do this we just need to implement the [IERC7802](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7802-crosschain-token-interface/21508) interface.

**Note:** The `IERC7802` interface is designed to be **minimal** and only specifies the required function signatures (`crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn`) and events (`CrosschainMint` and `CrosschainBurn`). **Developers have complete control over how these functions are implemented**, including the logic for handling cross-chain minting and burning. This allows flexibility to tailor the behavior to specific use cases or custom bridge solutions. In the example below we show how this interface is implemented for an example token that uses the [`SuperchainTokenBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/SuperchainTokenBridge.sol) for cross-chain minting and burning.

**1. Add the IERC7802 interface to the contract**

Import the `IERC7802` and update your contract to inherit from it.

```solidity
import { IERC7802 } from "@contracts-bedrock/L2/interfaces/IERC7802.sol";

contract GovernanceToken is IERC7802, ERC20Burnable, ERC20Votes, Ownable {
    // Contract implementation here
}
```

**2. Add the `crosschainMint` function to the contract**

The `crosschainMint` function defines how tokens are minted on the destination chain during a cross-chain transfer. While the interface requires the function's signature, **the implementation is entirely up to you.**

In this example, only the `SuperchainTokenBridge` contract will have permissions to mint the token during a crosschain transfer. If you‚Äôre using a custom bridge, you could replace `SuperchainTokenBridge` with your bridge contract and implement the desired logic. You can customize this function to add any logic or access control as needed.

```solidity
/// @notice Allows the SuperchainTokenBridge to mint tokens.
/// @param _to     Address to mint tokens to.
/// @param _amount Amount of tokens to mint.
function crosschainMint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external {
    // Only the `SuperchainTokenBridge` has permissions to mint tokens during crosschain transfers.
    if (msg.sender != Predeploys.SUPERCHAIN_TOKEN_BRIDGE) revert Unauthorized();
    
    // Mint tokens to the `_to` account's balance.
    _mint(_to, _amount);

    // Emit the CrosschainMint event included on IERC7802 for tracking token mints associated with cross chain transfers.
    emit CrosschainMint(_to, _amount, msg.sender);
}
```

**3. Add the `crosschainBurn` function to the contract**
The `crosschainBurn` function defines how tokens are burned on the source chain during a cross-chain transfer. Again, while the interface specifies the function signature, **the implementation is completely flexible.**

In this example, only the `SuperchainTokenBridge` contract will have permissions to burn the token during a crosschain transfer. However, you can modify this to fit your requirements.

```solidity
/// @notice Allows the SuperchainTokenBridge to burn tokens.
/// @param _from   Address to burn tokens from.
/// @param _amount Amount of tokens to burn.
function crosschainBurn(address _from, uint256 _amount) external {
    // Only the `SuperchainTokenBridge` has permissions to burn tokens during crosschain transfers.
    if (msg.sender != Predeploys.SUPERCHAIN_TOKEN_BRIDGE) revert Unauthorized();

    // Burn the tokens from the `_from` account's balance.
    _burn(_from, _amount);

    // Emit the CrosschainBurn event included on IERC7802 for tracking token burns associated with cross chain transfers.
    emit CrosschainBurn(_from, _amount, msg.sender);
}
```

**4. Add the `supportsInterface` function to the contract**

Since `IERC7802` is an extension of [IERC165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165), your contract must implement the `supportsInterface` function to indicate which interfaces it supports.

In this example our token supports `IERC7802`, `IERC20`, and `IERC165`

```solidity
/// @notice Query if a contract implements an interface
/// @param interfaceID The interface identifier, as specified in ERC-165
/// @dev Interface identification is specified in ERC-165. This function
/// uses less than 30,000 gas.
/// @return `true` if the contract implements `interfaceID` and
/// `interfaceID` is not 0xffffffff, `false` otherwise
function supportsInterface(bytes4 _interfaceId) public view virtual returns (bool) {
    return _interfaceId == type(IERC7802).interfaceId || _interfaceId == type(IERC20).interfaceId
        || _interfaceId == type(IERC165).interfaceId;
}
```

After following these four steps your token is ready to be interoperable! The full example contract is available [here](packages/contracts/src/examples/L2NativeInteroperableGovernanceToken.sol).

This example showcases that the `IERC7802` interface does not enforce any specific logic for handling cross-chain minting and burning. It only ensures that the required functions and events exist, leaving all implementation details entirely up to you. You can:
- Use any custom access control mechanisms for `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn`.
- Implement specific checks, restrictions, or business logic tailored to your token's requirements.
- Integrate the interface with your own bridge or use it with the `SuperchainTokenBridge`.
